## Running the code

To get this code running, you'll just need Node.js, npm and the Angular CLI. If you already have them, skip to step 3.

1. Download and run the Node.js installer for your platform from the official site (https://nodejs.org/en). It should come with npm. (on Windows, if it doesn't work, try adding Node to your PATH environment variable)
2. Once you've got npm, you just need to install the Angular CLI from the command line with this command:
    npm install -g @angular/cli
3. In the command line (or in your editor of choice), navigate to this project's folder and install its dependencies using:
    npm install
4. After the packages are installed, run:
    ng serve
5. It should start a local web server, from which the site can be accessed through:
    http://localhost:4200
